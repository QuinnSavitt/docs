### Integers

Integer literals are defined by repeated `tun`s followed by a closing `sahur`. The value is defined as the number of `tun`s minus 1.

```
tun tun tun tun tun sahur -> 4 <-
tun sahur -> 0 <-
```

### Booleans

Boolean literals are defined as the following mapping: `sigma`-\>True `beta`-\>False.

### Strings

String literals are opened by `legit` and closed by `bro`.

```
legit Hello World! bro -> "Hello World!"
```

\*\*LIMITATION: \*\*Strings in tspmo cannot begin or end with a space.

### Floats

You cannot create float literals directly, but can through `bigf` divisions and `tf` conversions. [See [Arithmetic Operators](/arithmeticOperators)]

### Lists

Lists cannot be initialized containing data, but can be initialized empty using `ls`
